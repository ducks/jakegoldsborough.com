      <h3 id="the-plot-twist">The Plot Twist</h3>
<p>Remember that <a href="/blog/2025/contributing-to-aws-sdk-ruby/">AWS SDK
contribution</a>
I wrote about? The one where I fixed missing <code>credential_source = Environment</code>
support? Well, turns out that was only half the story.</p>
<p>After my PR got merged and we updated our Discourse deployment to <code>aws-sdk-core 3.233.0</code>, I was excited to finally see role assumption working. The missing
credential source was fixed, our config looked perfect, and all the unit tests
were passing.</p>
<p>But when I deployed it to our test cluster, I still got an error. It was a new
error, but an error nonetheless. Instead of <code>UnsupportedCredentialType</code>, I was
now getting a permission denied error when trying to use AWS S3 operations.</p>
<h3 id="the-real-problem">The Real Problem</h3>
<p>Here's what was happening. I'd check the identity in our Rails console:</p>
<pre data-lang="ruby" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ruby "><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span>discourse(prod)&gt; sts = </span><span style="color:#ebcb8b;">Aws</span><span>::</span><span style="color:#ebcb8b;">STS</span><span>::</span><span style="color:#ebcb8b;">Client</span><span>.</span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">new
</span><span>discourse(prod)&gt; </span><span style="color:#96b5b4;">puts</span><span> sts.get_caller_identity.arn
</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">arn:aws:</span><span>iam::</span><span style="color:#d08770;">123456789012</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">:user</span><span>/</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">MyUser
</span></code></pre>
<p>That should have been showing an assumed role ARN like:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>arn:aws:iam::123456789012:assumed-role/MyRole/session-name
</span></code></pre>
<p>The SDK was still using environment variables directly instead of using them as
source credentials to assume the configured role.</p>
<h3 id="the-investigation-round-2">The Investigation (Round 2)</h3>
<p>Back to the AWS SDK source code, this time looking at
<code>credential_provider_chain.rb</code>. And there it was - a classic ordering problem:</p>
<pre data-lang="ruby" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ruby "><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#b48ead;">def </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">providers
</span><span>[
</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># ... other providers ...
</span><span>[</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">:env_credentials</span><span>, {}], </span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Position 7 ← Wins!
</span><span style="color:#65737e;"># ... other providers ...
</span><span>[</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">:assume_role_credentials</span><span>, {}], </span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Position 10 ← Never reached
</span><span>]
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">end
</span></code></pre>
<p>The credential chain finds <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> in
position 7, returns those credentials immediately, and never reaches the role
assumption logic at position 10.</p>
<p>But here's the thing - this isn't as simple as just moving
<code>assume_role_credentials</code> higher in the chain. That might break existing
behavior for thousands of applications that rely on direct environment variable
usage.</p>
<h3 id="the-real-architecture-problem">The Real Architecture Problem</h3>
<p>What should happen with this config:</p>
<pre data-lang="ini" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ini "><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span style="color:#b48ead;">[default]
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">role_arn </span><span>= arn:aws:iam::</span><span style="color:#d08770;">123456789012</span><span>:role/MyRole
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">credential_source </span><span>= Environment
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">role_session_name </span><span>= test-session
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">region </span><span>= us-west-</span><span style="color:#d08770;">2
</span></code></pre>
<p><strong>Expected flow:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SDK sees <code>role_arn</code> + <code>credential_source = Environment</code></li>
<li>SDK uses <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>/<code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> as <strong>source credentials</strong></li>
<li>SDK calls <code>AssumeRole</code> with those source credentials</li>
<li>SDK returns <strong>assumed role credentials</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Actual flow:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>SDK finds <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code>/<code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> in environment</li>
<li>SDK returns those credentials directly (chain stops)</li>
<li>Role assumption config is never processed</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-contribution">The Contribution</h3>
<p>I filed <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/issues/3301">Bug #3301</a> with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear reproduction steps</li>
<li>Root cause analysis pointing to the specific code location</li>
<li>Expected vs. actual behavior with ARN examples</li>
<li>A workaround using <code>source_profile</code> (though it requires plaintext keys)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-response">The Response</h3>
<p>The AWS team's response was exactly what you hope for:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hey, thanks for opening an issue. I believe you are correct and this is
something we need to fix. I need to confirm some details regarding
AssumeRoleCredentials profile chaining with the team first and I'll keep you
updated."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's maintainer validation that this is a real architectural issue, not user
error.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned-again">What I Learned (Again)</h3>
<p><strong>Complex systems have complex bugs:</strong> My first fix solved the missing feature,
but revealed a deeper architectural problem with credential chain precedence.</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes the obvious fix isn't right:</strong> Moving <code>assume_role_credentials</code>
higher might seem simple, but it requires careful consideration of context and
backward compatibility.</p>
<p><strong>Good bug reports matter:</strong> Clear reproduction steps, root cause analysis, and
concrete examples help maintainers understand and prioritize issues.</p>
<p><strong>Persistence pays off:</strong> I could have stopped after the first fix and lived
with workarounds. But pushing deeper led to identifying a more fundamental
issue.</p>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>This experience reinforced something important about systems work: fixing one
layer often reveals problems in the next layer down.</p>
<p>The first bug was a missing feature - straightforward to implement. The second
bug is an architectural design issue that requires careful consideration of how
credential resolution should work when role assumption is involved.</p>
<p>Both bugs are real, both needed fixing, and both will help developers who hit
the same issues. But they required completely different approaches - one needed
code, the other needed a thoughtful design discussion with the maintainers.</p>
<h3 id="status-update">Status Update</h3>
<p>As of this writing, the AWS team is discussing the fix for the credential chain
precedence issue. Our Discourse implementation is ready to go - we're just
waiting on the upstream architectural fix.</p>
<p>Sometimes the best contribution you can make is clearly identifying and
documenting a problem, even when the solution isn't obvious. That's exactly
what happened here.</p>
<h3 id="the-adventure-continues">The Adventure Continues</h3>

up implementing.</p>
