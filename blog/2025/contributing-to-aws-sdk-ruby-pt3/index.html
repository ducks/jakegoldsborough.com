      <h3 id="the-saga-continues">The Saga Continues</h3>
<p>If you've been following along (<a href="/blog/2025/contributing-to-aws-sdk-ruby/">Part
1</a> and
<a href="/blog/2025/contributing-to-aws-sdk-ruby-pt2/">Part
2</a>),
you know I've been on a journey fixing AWS SDK Ruby credential handling. First
I added the missing <code>credential_source = Environment</code> implementation, then I
discovered it didn't actually work due to credential chain precedence issues.</p>
<p>After extensive testing and code analysis, I submitted <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/pull/3303">PR
#3303</a> with a fix. The
maintainer initially responded positively:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hey, thanks for opening an issue. I believe you are correct and this is
something we need to fix."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great! But then...</p>
<h3 id="the-reversal">The Reversal</h3>
<p>After I provided detailed testing comparing AWS CLI behavior, demonstrated the
fix working in production, and showed exactly which code was unreachable due to
the chain precedence, the maintainer walked it back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"From what I understand, I think the default chain will try to resolve
credentials as quickly as possible, so if environment variables are set it will
use them directly instead of using them as a credential source. We try not to
change the behavior of the default chain since returning credentials in a
different order can break many customers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then closed both the issue and PR.</p>
<h3 id="why-this-is-wrong">Why This Is Wrong</h3>
<p><strong>1. The Feature Is Completely Broken</strong></p>
<p>When you configure:</p>
<pre data-lang="ini" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ini "><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span style="color:#b48ead;">[default]
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">role_arn </span><span>= arn:aws:iam::</span><span style="color:#d08770;">123456789012</span><span>:role/MyRole
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">credential_source </span><span>= Environment
</span></code></pre>
<p>What happens?</p>
<ol>
<li><code>env_credentials</code> (position 7) finds <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and
<code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code></li>
<li>Chain returns those credentials and stops</li>
<li><code>assume_role_credentials</code> (position 10) never executes</li>
<li>The <code>role_arn</code> and <code>credential_source</code> configuration is <strong>completely
ignored</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The maintainer confirmed this: "All of the <code>static_profile_</code> methods handle
credentials resolution when a client is configured explicitly with a profile."</p>
<p>So the feature works... but only if you don't use the credential chain, which
defeats the entire purpose of having a credential chain.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Code Contradicts Their Argument</strong></p>
<p>Look at
<a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-ruby/blob/version-3/gems/aws-sdk-core/lib/aws-sdk-core/shared_config.rb#L392-L400"><code>shared_config.rb:392-400</code></a>:</p>
<pre data-lang="ruby" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ruby "><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#b48ead;">def </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">credentials_from_source</span><span>(</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">credential_source</span><span>, </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">config</span><span>)
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">case</span><span> credential_source
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">when </span><span>&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">Ec2InstanceMetadata</span><span>&#39;
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#65737e;"># ...
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">when </span><span>&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">EcsContainer</span><span>&#39;
</span><span>    </span><span style="color:#65737e;"># ...
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">when </span><span>&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">Environment</span><span>&#39;
</span><span>    creds = </span><span style="color:#ebcb8b;">Credentials</span><span>.</span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">new</span><span>(
</span><span>      </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">ENV</span><span>[&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</span><span>&#39;],
</span><span>      </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">ENV</span><span>[&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</span><span>&#39;],
</span><span>      </span><span style="color:#bf616a;">ENV</span><span>[&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">AWS_SESSION_TOKEN</span><span>&#39;]
</span><span>    )
</span><span>    creds.metrics = [&#39;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">CREDENTIALS_ENV_VARS</span><span>&#39;]
</span><span>    creds
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">end
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">end
</span></code></pre>
<p>This code exists specifically to use environment variables as source credentials
for role assumption. But the credential chain prevents it from ever executing
when using the default profile.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Workaround Proves It's Broken</strong></p>
<p>The maintainer suggested: "if specifying the profile resolves your issue I
would recommend doing that."</p>
<p>But that's not a solution, it's an admission the feature is broken. The
credential chain exists so you DON'T have to explicitly pass <code>profile:</code>
parameters everywhere. Setting <code>AWS_PROFILE=default</code> or using the default
profile should work. That's the entire design philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>4. Who Would This "Break"?</strong></p>
<p>The maintainer worried about "breaking many customers." But let's think about
this:</p>
<p>My fix only affects users who have <strong>both</strong> of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>A profile with <code>role_arn</code> AND <code>credential_source = Environment</code></li>
<li>Environment variables <code>AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID</code> and <code>AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY</code> set</li>
</ul>
<p>If someone configures both, they're explicitly declaring: "use these
environment variables AS SOURCE CREDENTIALS to assume this role."</p>
<p>Who would configure this and expect it to be ignored? That's not a customer
being protected, that's a broken feature being excused.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-did-instead">What I Did Instead</h3>
<p>Since the AWS team won't fix the credential chain, I worked around it by
explicitly passing the <code>profile:</code> parameter to AWS SDK clients. This bypasses
the broken credential chain entirely.</p>
<p>The approach is simple:</p>
<pre data-lang="ruby" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ruby "><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span style="color:#b48ead;">def </span><span style="color:#8fa1b3;">aws_client_options
</span><span>  opts = { </span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">region:</span><span> config.region }
</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Explicitly pass profile if configured
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">if</span><span> config.profile.present?
</span><span>    opts[</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">:profile</span><span>] = config.profile
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">elsif</span><span> config.access_key_id.present? &amp;&amp; config.secret_key.present?
</span><span>    opts[</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">:access_key_id</span><span>] = config.access_key_id
</span><span>    opts[</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">:secret_access_key</span><span>] = config.secret_key
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#b48ead;">end
</span><span>  </span><span style="color:#65737e;"># Otherwise omit credentials, let SDK auto-discover
</span><span>
</span><span>  opts
</span><span style="color:#b48ead;">end
</span></code></pre>
<p>With AWS config:</p>
<pre data-lang="ini" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-ini "><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini"><span style="color:#b48ead;">[profile app-uploads]
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">role_arn </span><span>= arn:aws:iam::</span><span style="color:#d08770;">123456789012</span><span>:role/AppUploads
</span><span style="color:#bf616a;">credential_source </span><span>= Environment
</span></code></pre>
<p>This works because explicitly passing <code>profile:</code> to the SDK bypasses the broken
credential chain and goes directly to the profile-based role assumption code.
It's not fixing the SDK bug, but it enables working role assumption with
temporary credentials instead of long-lived static keys.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-learned-the-hard-way">What I Learned (The Hard Way)</h3>
<p><strong>Open source maintainers aren't always right.</strong> Even when they're from AWS,
even when they're maintaining critical infrastructure, they can make bad
decisions.</p>
<p><strong>Document your wins even when they don't get merged.</strong> This fix works in
production. Other developers will hit this same issue. Having a public record
of the problem and solution helps everyone.</p>
<p><strong>The bug report itself has value.</strong> Even though they closed it, the issue and
PR document exactly what's broken and why. Future developers will find it and
understand they're not crazy. The feature really is broken.</p>
<h3 id="the-bigger-picture">The Bigger Picture</h3>
<p>This experience reminded me technical correctness doesn't always win.</p>
<p>I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear reproduction steps</li>
<li>Root cause analysis with line numbers</li>
<li>A working fix with tests</li>
<li>Production validation</li>
<li>Comparison with AWS CLI behavior</li>
<li>Maintainer acknowledgment that it was broken</li>
</ul>
<p>And they still closed it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the politics of "don't change anything" beat "fix the broken
feature." That's frustrating, but it's reality.</p>
<h3 id="for-other-contributors">For Other Contributors</h3>
<p>If you hit this issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes, <code>credential_source = Environment</code> is broken with the default credential
chain</li>
<li>No, it's not you, it's the SDK</li>
<li>The workaround is explicitly passing <code>profile:</code> to clients (or using
<code>source_profile</code> with plaintext keys)</li>
<li>Explicitly passing the profile parameter bypasses the broken chain and
enables proper role assumption</li>
</ol>
<p>For AWS maintainers reading this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have unreachable code in <code>credentials_from_source</code></li>
<li>Your credential chain prevents documented features from working</li>
<li>"Breaking changes" is a poor excuse for not fixing broken features</li>
<li>The feature is already broken for everyone using default profiles</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-end-for-now">The End (For Now)</h3>
<p>This is where the story ends. I found a workaround, documented it for others,
and moved on.</p>
<p>Sometimes that's all you can do. Sometimes "no" from maintainers means finding
another path. Sometimes proving you're technically correct doesn't matter if
the project isn't willing to fix their bugs.</p>
<p>But hey, at least the deployment works now. And maybe this blog series will
help the next developer who hits this same wall and wonders why a documented
feature doesn't actually work.</p>
<p>The adventure is over. The bug remains. The workaround persists.</p>
<p>Such is open source.</p>
