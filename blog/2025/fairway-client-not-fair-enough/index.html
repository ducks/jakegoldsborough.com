      <h3 id="takedown-request">Takedown Request</h3>
<p>Recently, I've been writing about reverse engineering a unique data
structure I found while investigating the UDisc web app. I also created
a free and open source library called Fairway Client. It's a fair way for
accessing UDisc's <code>.data</code> endpoints - the same ones their own web app uses.
These are public, unauthenticated endpoints available to any browser.</p>
<p>The only intent was curiosity and a belief in open, user-accessible data
and software. People have asked for this kind of access before, and
UDisc has repeatedly said no. So I decided to see for myself. The data
was right there - how hard could it be?</p>
<p>Turns out, not very.</p>
<p>Much of this data is <strong>user-submitted</strong>, and in some cases, <strong>user-paid</strong>.
UDisc does offer a CSV export, but come on - programming is about
automation, not downloading spreadsheets.</p>
<p>I posted about my findings and tools on the UDisc forum. That didn't go
well. First, I didn't realize posts were moderated so my comment never got
posted and that's on me. Second, they weren't pleased. I received a sternly
worded email asking me to remove both the blog series and the codebase.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure what to expect - but I was still disappointed.
I was hoping for curiosity, maybe even appreciation.
Instead, I got a takedown request.</p>
<p>They cited their ToS, but if offering a clean, read-only interface to user-owned
public data violates the ToS, maybe it's the ToS that is wrong.</p>
<p>The the code is down. I will be obscuring the posts to not reveal details but I
have spent time and effort on them so they will be staying up in some form.</p>
<p>It might be time to give disc golf metrix a shot:
