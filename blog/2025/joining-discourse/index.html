      <p>Today I am joining <a href="https://discourse.org">Discourse</a> as a software engineer on
the infrastructure team.</p>
<h3 id="who-is-discourse">Who is Discourse?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next
decade of the Internet. We make it easy to have meaningful conversations and
collaborate anytime, anywhere.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are the home of ~22k communities across 23 countries and 13 timezones.</p>
<h3 id="why-discourse">Why Discourse?</h3>
<p>I'm excited about working at Discourse for a number of reasons really.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Most of my tech and programming focused life has revolved around open source
software and it's always been a dream to get paid to work on an open source
software project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's a software engineer role on the infrastructure team. I was introduced
to DevOps work at my last job and fell down the rabbit hole. I love config
based workflows so things like IaC and NixOS have really clicked.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The company as a whole. This kind of goes with number 1 but I feel very
aligned with Discourse as a company. We work in an async format while being
completely remote. The company is very transparent, inclusive, and let's be
real, the benefits are great.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I think this can be a very important and fulfilling chapter of my professional
and personal life and I'm looking forward to making the internet a better place
through open source software.</p>
<p>This is the second time now I've lost a job then found a much, much better one.
I think this is a valuable lesson to try and remember if I'm in that situation
again.</p>
<p>If Discourse sounds like the place for you, see if we're hiring:
