      <p>I've shipped more projects in the last three months than I did in the previous
year. Are they all perfect? No. Are they all polished production-grade code?
Hell no. Do I care? Not even a little bit.</p>
<p>I'm having the time of my life building whatever idea pops into my head, and AI
is the reason I can actually finish things instead of just thinking about them.</p>
<p>And look, shipping isn't everything. Sometimes the best code never sees the
light of day. Sometimes you build something just to learn, or just because it
sounds fun. But there's something deeply satisfying about making things that
actually work - even if they're just for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-ve-been-building">What I've Been Building</h2>
<p>In the last few months alone:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ducks/vimdeck.nvim">vimdeck.nvim</a></strong>: Markdown presentations in Neovim using Treesitter</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ducks/mdpreview.nvim">mdpreview.nvim</a></strong>: Live markdown preview in a split window</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ducks/discourse-yaks">discourse-yaks</a></strong>: Virtual currency system for forum posts</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ducks/discourse-transit-tracker">discourse-transit-tracker</a></strong>: Turn forums into live departure boards</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ducks/discourse-invite-stats">discourse-invite-stats</a></strong>: Invite reporting and analytics plugin</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/ducks/shelltrax">shelltrax</a></strong>: TUI music player in Rust (my daily driver now)</li>
<li>Plus a handful of smaller tools and fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these are polished. Some are "good enough for me." All of them work.
All of them solve real problems I had. And I built most of them in a day or
two.</p>
<h2 id="the-slop-criticism">The "Slop" Criticism</h2>
<p>There's this narrative that AI-generated code is "slop." Low quality, generic,
copy-pasted garbage that's polluting the internet. And sure, that exists. That
existed before AI when people would blindly copy from Stack Overflow. But
the criticism misses something important:</p>
<p>When you're building for yourself, "slop" doesn't matter.</p>
<p>I'm not pushing half-baked code to production systems. I'm not claiming my
afternoon projects are enterprise-ready. I'm building tools that solve my
problems, learning by doing, and having fun.</p>
<p>If the markdown preview plugin has rough edges, who cares? It works for me. If
the presentation tool doesn't handle every edge case, so what? It renders my
slides.</p>
<p>The "slop" criticism only matters when you're shipping garbage and calling it
gold. When you're building for yourself? Ship it, iterate, move on.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-actually-happening">What's Actually Happening</h2>
<p>Here's what working with AI looks like for me:</p>
<p>I have an idea. "I want to do presentations in Neovim." Instead of spending a
week researching markdown parsers and figlet integration and buffer management,
I describe what I want and start building.</p>
<p>The AI suggests approaches. Some work. Some don't. We iterate. I learn what
Treesitter can do. I understand how Neovim's highlight system works. I see
patterns I wouldn't have thought of.</p>
<p>A few hours later, I have a working plugin.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? No. Did I learn a ton? Yes. Can I actually use it? Absolutely.</p>
<h2 id="the-joy-of-building">The Joy of Building</h2>
<p>What the critics miss is how much fun this is.</p>
<p>I used to have a backlog of ideas that never got built. "Someday I'll make
that." "That would be cool but it's too much work." "I don't have time to learn
X framework."</p>
<p>Now? I just build it.</p>
<p>Want to visualize invite relationships as an ASCII tree? Build it. Want live
transit departures in a forum? Build it. Want to fix a bug in a YAML parser?
Build it and submit the fix upstream.</p>
<p>The barrier between "I wish this existed" and "I built this" has collapsed. And
that's incredible.</p>
<h2 id="but-is-it-actually-good-code">But Is It Actually Good Code?</h2>
<p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no. And that's fine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/kddnewton/psych-pure/pull/30">Ruby psych-pure bug fix</a> I
submitted? That's good code. Full test coverage, proper edge case handling,
clean implementation. It's going into a production library.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/ducks/discourse-transit-tracker">transit tracker</a>? It
works, handles 500k+ MTA stop times, and has solid patterns for data
downloading and parsing. Could the UI be more polished? Sure. But it does what
I need and I learned a ton building it.</p>
<p>The key is knowing the difference. When it matters, I put in the work. When
it's just for me, I ship it and move on.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-productivity-hack">The Real Productivity Hack</h2>
<p>Working with AI isn't about replacing thinking. It's about spending your brain
cycles on the interesting problems instead of the boring setup work.</p>
<p>I don't want to spend three hours setting up test infrastructure. I want to
spend three hours solving the actual problem. AI handles the grunt work. I
handle the decisions.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-vibe-and-still-be-productive">You Can Vibe and Still Be Productive</h2>
<p>Here's the thing: you can have fun, move fast, and still produce quality work.
It's not either/or.</p>
<p>I'm "vibing out" projects. Building whatever sounds interesting. Shipping fast.
And yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>The code works</li>
<li>The tests pass</li>
<li>The bugs get fixed</li>
<li>The upstream contributions get merged</li>
</ul>
<p>You can be a pig in shit and still do good work. The slop is the medium, not
the output.</p>
<h2 id="the-gatekeeping-problem">The Gatekeeping Problem</h2>
<p>A lot of the "AI slop" criticism is just gatekeeping in disguise.</p>
<p>"Real programmers don't use AI." "You're not actually learning." "This is
ruining software quality."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm shipping. Learning by building. Contributing to open source.
Having fun.</p>
<p>The gatekeepers can argue about the "right way" to write code. I'm too busy
building things.</p>
<h2 id="what-actually-matters">What Actually Matters</h2>
<p>At the end of the day, here's what matters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it work?</li>
<li>Did you learn something?</li>
<li>Are you having fun?</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer to those three questions is yes, then it doesn't matter if
someone on Twitter thinks your code is "slop."</p>
<p>You're building. They're complaining. You win.</p>
<h2 id="like-a-pig-in-shit">Like a Pig in Shit</h2>
<p>So yeah, I'm rolling around in the AI slop. Building projects at a pace I never
could before. Shipping tools that solve real problems. Learning by doing
instead of just reading about it. Old me would think I was full of shit if I
tried explaining this.</p>
<p>Call it slop if you want. I'm too busy having the time of my life to care.</p>
<p>The pig pen is the place for me.</p>
