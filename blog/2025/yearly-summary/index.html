      <h1 id="2025-yearly-recap">2025 Yearly Recap</h1>
<h2 id="a-year-of-building-shipping-and-showing-the-work">A Year of Building, Shipping, and Showing the Work</h2>
<p>2025 was the year things stopped being ideas in progress and started
becoming systems with gravity. Across code, writing, travel, and
creative work, the through-line was consistency: small, composable
pieces that add up to something durable.</p>
<p>The pace was intentional. Ship in public. Measure lightly. Let
curiosity decide what compounds.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="open-source-and-engineering">Open Source and Engineering</h2>
<p>This was a deeply technical year, but not driven by framework churn.
It was about foundations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continued deep investment in Rust, especially for CLI and TUI tooling</li>
<li>Multiple self-authored tools reached real usability:
<ul>
<li>Static resume generation</li>
<li>Budgeting and finance tooling</li>
<li>Audio and scrobbling infrastructure</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Strong preference for:
<ul>
<li>Plain data formats</li>
<li>Deterministic builds</li>
<li>Git as a source of truth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Clear move away from "just ship JSON" toward intentional data modeling</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongside that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Declarative systems (NixOS, Docker Compose, reproducible infra)</li>
<li>CLI-first design, with UI as a layer rather than a dependency</li>
<li>Energy-aware and sustainability-minded technical choices</li>
</ul>
<p>A recurring pattern this year: build tools you actually want to use,
then refine them until they feel obvious.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="writing-blogging-and-metrics">Writing, Blogging, and Metrics</h2>
<p>In 2025, the blog stopped feeling like a side project and started acting
like a signal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent long-form technical writing</li>
<li>Multi-part series and deep dives</li>
<li>Willingness to publish unfinished thinking and iterate publicly</li>
</ul>
<p>The results were quiet but meaningful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic traffic from multiple search engines</li>
<li>Readers arriving via GitHub, chat tools, and RSS</li>
<li>Early signs of compounding interest rather than spikes</li>
</ul>
<p>Metrics stayed in their place: feedback, not validation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="travel-and-perspective-shifts">Travel and Perspective Shifts</h2>
<p>Travel this year was less about movement and more about recalibration.</p>
<p>Time spent in Europe, especially Central Europe, reinforced:</p>
<ul>
<li>A preference for walkable cities</li>
<li>Public transit that works</li>
<li>Slower, more deliberate daily rhythms</li>
</ul>
<p>It also sharpened longer-term thinking around relocation, digital-nomad
feasibility, and how much infrastructure is actually needed to live
well.</p>
<p>This wasn't escapism. It was alignment.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="disc-golf-outdoors-and-sustainability">Disc Golf, Outdoors, and Sustainability</h2>
<p>Disc golf remained a grounding constant.</p>
<p>Not just as a hobby, but as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A recurring design constraint (maps, data, APIs)</li>
<li>A sustainability touchstone</li>
<li>A reminder that systems should work outside, not just on screens</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus subtly shifted from collecting and optimizing toward
understanding spaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courses as designed environments</li>
<li>Flow, access, and maintenance</li>
<li>How technology can support, not dominate, physical experiences</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="creative-work-beyond-code">Creative Work Beyond Code</h2>
<p>2025 also made room for making things with your hands.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pottery experiments</li>
<li>Tufting and material exploration</li>
<li>Visual identity and logo work</li>
</ul>
<p>These fed back into engineering work by reinforcing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process over output</li>
<li>Material constraints</li>
<li>Iteration without metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>That cross-pollination showed up everywhere.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="career-and-direction">Career and Direction</h2>
<p>Professionally, this was a year of alignment.</p>
<p>The focus moved further toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open-source adjacent work</li>
<li>Tooling that empowers communities</li>
<li>Infrastructure that disappears when it works</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than chasing titles or hype, the emphasis stayed on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taste</li>
<li>Maintainability</li>
<li>Systems that still make sense six months later</li>
</ul>
<p>The result was confidence rooted in practice, not positioning.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-shape-of-things-going-forward">The Shape of Things Going Forward</h2>
<p>If 2024 was about exploration, 2025 was about integration.</p>
<p>There is now:</p>
<ul>
<li>A coherent technical stack</li>
<li>A public body of work</li>
<li>Clear values around sustainability, simplicity, and ownership</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, the year ends with momentum that feels calm rather
than frantic.</p>
<p>That is the kind that lasts.</p>
