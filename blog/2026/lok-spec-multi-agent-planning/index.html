      <p>The hardest part of building software isn't writing code. It's figuring out what
to build and in what order. LLMs are great at generating code, but they're also
great at generating the wrong code because they started implementing before
thinking through the structure.</p>
<p>That's what <code>lok spec</code> solves.</p>
<p>This post describes the shape of the system: how lok structures planning, what
guarantees the spec format provides, and why separation between planner and
executor matters. The implementation of the executor (agents actually writing
code) is not covered here. This is about constraints and contracts.</p>
<h2 id="what-lok-is-not">What Lok is not</h2>
<p>Before going further:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not a chatbot framework or conversational interface</li>
<li>Not a marketplace or plugin system for third-party agents</li>
<li>Not trying to replace developers with automation</li>
</ul>
<p>Lok is a planner that structures work and an executor that requires explicit
human approval at every phase boundary. The design assumes humans review specs,
trigger execution, and validate results.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-just-build-it">The Problem with "Just Build It"</h2>
<p>When you give an LLM a big task like "build a C compiler," it starts coding
immediately. Maybe it picks the lexer first, maybe the parser. Maybe it designs
types that won't work for later phases. By the time you realize the architecture
is wrong, you've burned tokens and time.</p>
<p>The fix is obvious in retrospect: plan before you build. But not just any plan.
A plan that multiple models have debated and converged on.</p>
<h2 id="propose-refine-pick">Propose, Refine, Pick</h2>
<p><code>lok spec</code> uses a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Propose</strong>: All backends generate roadmaps in parallel</li>
<li><strong>Refine</strong>: Synthesize roadmaps into a consensus plan</li>
<li><strong>Pick</strong>: Generate detailed specs from the consensus</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the same pattern as debate mode, but applied to planning instead of
analysis. Each backend proposes how they'd structure the project. Then we
synthesize the best ideas and resolve contradictions. Finally, we generate
specs that capture the agreed approach.</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Four backends looked at "build a C compiler" and each proposed a roadmap. Claude
synthesized them into a unified plan. Then we generated specs for each step, and
broke each step into subtasks (individual files).</p>
<h2 id="the-output-structure">The Output Structure</h2>
<p>Specs land in <code>.arf/specs/</code> with a nested structure:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>.arf/specs/
</span><span>  roadmap.arf
</span><span>  01-lexer/
</span><span>    spec.arf
</span><span>    01-token.arf
</span><span>    02-cursor.arf
</span><span>    03-scanner.arf
</span><span>    04-keywords.arf
</span><span>  02-ast/
</span><span>    spec.arf
</span><span>    01-types.arf
</span><span>    02-expr.arf
</span><span>    ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>The roadmap is the high-level plan. Each numbered directory is a step. Inside
each step is a <code>spec.arf</code> with the overall component spec, plus subtask files
for individual pieces.</p>
<p>A spec file looks like this:</p>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Review the roadmap and specs. If the plan looks wrong, edit the <code>.arf</code> files or
regenerate. Once satisfied:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">lok</span><span> implement .arf/specs/
</span></code></pre>
<p>Agents read each spec and implement the changes directly. Each agent works on
its assigned file according to the spec. The boundary between planning and
execution is the review gate - you decide when to run <code>lok implement</code> after
reviewing the specs.</p>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The spec files are <a href="https://github.com/ducks/arf">ARF</a> format. That means
they're structured, parseable, and auditable. When you review a spec, you're
reviewing the plan before any code exists. If the approach is wrong, you catch
it here, not after 10,000 lines of generated code.</p>
<p>The subtask breakdown is what enables parallel execution. Once you have specs
for <code>01-token.arf</code>, <code>02-cursor.arf</code>, <code>03-scanner.arf</code>, and <code>04-keywords.arf</code>,
different agents can work on different files simultaneously. They're not
stepping on each other because each owns their file.</p>
<p>The pattern is recursive. <code>lok spec</code> on a project gives you steps. Each step
has subtasks. If a subtask is still too big, you could spec it again. Same
process, different scale.</p>
<p>The spec format enforces three invariants:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Serializable plans</strong>: Every decision is written down in parseable TOML.
You can diff plans, version them, replay them.</li>
<li><strong>Attributable actions</strong>: Each spec names the file it will modify or create.
No agent can touch code without a spec that declares intent.</li>
<li><strong>Human intervention points</strong>: Spec generation is separate from execution.
You review the plan before any code changes happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are not optimizations. They are constraints that prevent the system from
becoming a black box.</p>
<h2 id="human-in-the-loop-by-design">Human in the Loop by Design</h2>
<p>The separation between <code>lok spec</code> and execution is not a temporary limitation.
It is the core design. The system does not "learn" to skip human review or
"graduate" to autonomous operation.</p>
<p>Every phase boundary requires explicit human approval:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spec generation produces files you review before execution starts</li>
<li>Execution runs subtasks but does not merge or deploy results</li>
<li>Integration is a separate manual step</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not because the LLMs are not capable enough. It is because software
built by delegation requires inspection and veto power at decision boundaries.
The moment you remove that, you have an agent that makes choices you cannot
audit until after the damage is done.</p>
<h2 id="single-backend-fallback">Single Backend Fallback</h2>
<p>If you only have one backend configured, <code>lok spec</code> skips the multi-model
consensus and just asks that backend to plan and spec directly. You still get
the structured output, just without the debate.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#bf616a;">lok</span><span> spec</span><span style="color:#bf616a;"> --backend</span><span> claude &quot;</span><span style="color:#a3be8c;">Build a REST API</span><span>&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>The value of multi-backend consensus is catching blind spots. One model might
over-engineer the auth system while another keeps it simple. Synthesis finds
the middle ground. But if you're just exploring or don't have multiple backends
set up, single-model works fine.</p>
<h2 id="token-conservation">Token Conservation</h2>
<p>The multi-agent pattern has a cost: API calls. Four backends generating roadmaps
is four API calls. Synthesis is another. Spec generation is another. Subtask
generation is one per step.</p>
<p>For a 7-step project, that's roughly: 4 (roadmaps) + 1 (synthesize) + 1 (specs)</p>
<ul>
<li>7 (subtasks) = 13 API calls. Not cheap if you're using expensive models.</li>
</ul>
<p>But here's the key: every backend's contribution gets used. We're not querying
four models and throwing away three responses. We're synthesizing all four into
something better than any single response.</p>
<p>This is the rule I've been following: if you fire off multiple agents, they
must debate or synthesize. Never query N backends just to pick one.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next">What's Next</h2>
<p>The specs exist. The next step is execution: read the specs, assign agents to
subtasks, run them in parallel, integrate the results. That is a bigger piece of
machinery, but the foundation is here.</p>
<p>For now, <code>lok spec</code> gives you a structured plan that multiple models have
agreed on. Review it, tweak it if needed, then start building with confidence
that the architecture makes sense. The system does not get smarter by hiding
decisions from you. It gets more useful by making decisions inspectable.</p>
