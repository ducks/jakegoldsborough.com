Today I am joining [Discourse](https://discourse.org) as a software engineer on
the infrastructure team.

### Who is Discourse?

> Discourse is the 100% open source discussion platform built for the next
> decade of the Internet. We make it easy to have meaningful conversations and
> collaborate anytime, anywhere.

We are the home of ~22k communities across 23 countries and 13 timezones.

### Why Discourse?

I'm excited about working at Discourse for a number of reasons really.

1. Most of my tech and programming focused life has revolved around open source
   software and it's always been a dream to get paid to work on an open source
   software project.

2. It's a software engineer role on the infrastructure team. I was introduced
   to DevOps work at my last job and fell down the rabbit hole. I love config
   based workflows so things like IaC and NixOS have really clicked.

3. The company as a whole. This kind of goes with number 1 but I feel very
   aligned with Discourse as a company. We work in an async format while being
   completely remote. The company is very transparent, inclusive, and let's be
   real, the benefits are great.

I think this can be a very important and fulfilling chapter of my professional
and personal life and I'm looking forward to making the internet a better place
through open source software.

This is the second time now I've lost a job then found a much, much better one.
I think this is a valuable lesson to try and remember if I'm in that situation
again.
