#### Who is Vulfmon

Vulfmon is the alter ego/moniker of Vulfpeck leader Jack Stratton. He sometimes
shoots videos in a room with various art on the walls. In the video for
[Alone Again, Naturally](https://youtu.be/dTnHAITmuYQ), I noticed a weaving
that I loved:

Lucky for me, I just happened to have access to a loom and yarn. Like any new
skill, it was a bit awkward to start and honestly, my first one was rough. I
stuck with it though and have made many better ones including six inspired by
Vulfmon:
