I am starting a weekly summary/reflection series that will be a high level
view of things I have worked on or fixed or just things I want to track or note.

Things I enjoyed:
- deployed this site
- got an old raspberry pi running again
- started back into some rust learnings with blockchain, TUI, and MQTT hacking
  [^1] [^2] [^3]
- started working on a walnut utensil rest
- applied to 10 jobs

Things I did not enjoy:
- seemingly bricked my RockPro64 as it won't boot past a black screen. ordered
  an adapater to help debug at a lower level.
- rejected from multiple jobs
- felt very confused by some of the rust learnings. makes sense in pieces but
  hard to see as the whole picture just yet
- confirmed old fitbit can't be flashed with any open source/non-fitbit software
