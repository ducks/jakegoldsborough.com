This has been a pretty productive week.

Things that were good:
- RockPro64 boots again! Blog post coming...
- continued Swedish language studies - 165 days
- started work on some API inspection. Another blog post coming...
- figured out nixos/hyprland boot issue

Things that could be better:
- didn't work on much rust
- can't get gitea ssh setup on VPS
- broke wood router part so had to buy new one to work on utensil rest
