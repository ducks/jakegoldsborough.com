### 20250704 - 20250711

### Cyberspace

#### NixOS

- Published two posts in Daily Driver series. My late 2011 Macbook Pro running
  NixOs is already feeling ready for daily use really:
  - [Part 5](/blog/2025/nixos-daily-driver-5/)
  - [Part 6](/blog/2025/nixos-daily-driver-6/)

- Fighting encrypted disk installation. Installation seems fine but then I can't
  unlock drive to boot up.

### Meatspace

#### Disc Golf

- Played Pier Park
- Played Memorial Park
- Published post about experience with UDisc regarding my open source library:
  - [Fairway Client Not Fair Enough](/blog/2025/fairway-client-not-fair-enough/)

#### Language Studies

**Swedish**

- 204 day streak on Babbel. Did a few more lessons this week and not just
  review. Listened to some Radio Sweden på lätt Svenska (Radio Sweden in easy
  Swedish)

**Czech/German**

- I found out I'll be going to Prague in Sept so I may try to pick up a little
  Czech and brush up on German as many speak it there apparently.

#### Garden
- Harvested 3 squash
- Blueberry bush is fruiting
- Raspberry bush is flowering
- Tomatoes are flowering/growing
- New tomato and pepper starts are doing well

### Music

- Listened to a lot of Top Dawg Entertainment this week - Kendrick Lamar,
  Ab-Soul, Doechii, Schoolboy-Q
