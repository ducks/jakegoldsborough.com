**Nix package development**

We discussed writing a Nix package for a complex project with multiple
resources, using the Discourse install-cloud guide as a template to structure
derivations and manage dependencies cleanly.

**NixOS Wi-Fi on Framework 16**

We troubleshooted nmcli reporting the Intel AX210 as DOWN, enabled wireless in
configuration.nix, and resolved common pitfalls to bring up the wireless
interface successfully.

**Git commit signing**

We covered forcing Git to use a specific SSH key for a given repository, how to
resign commits, and how to update the commit email so that signatures appear
valid.

**Hyprland keybinds**

We added a custom Hyprland keybind to close the active window with a
confirmation dialog, and refined the yes/no prompts and dialog appearance for
better usability.

**Terraform and Nomad learning**

We explored practical resources--sample projects, tutorials, and sandbox
environments--to build hands-on experience with Terraform and Nomad
orchestration.

**Bluetooth audio input**

We investigated why LibreWolf failed to detect a Bluetooth headset mic,
including how to identify the board, check firmware versions, and verify
driver support.

**Email server on NixOS**

We outlined setting up a mail server on NixOS and using Caddy to automate TLS
certificate issuance for secure SMTP and IMAP provisioning.

**Privacy-focused smartwatches**

We reviewed open-source options like the PineTime, diagnosed step-counter
failures, checked return policies, and sketched a plan for a Rust-based long-
term step tracker integrated with Gadgetbridge.

**Swedish Studies**

221 days in a row on Babbel. Listened to audio books as well this week.
