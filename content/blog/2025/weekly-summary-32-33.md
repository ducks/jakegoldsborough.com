**Early August Projects**

The first week of August was centered on your Node-postgres-exporter work.
You finished the conversion to ESM and TypeScript and started thinking about
next steps. Around the same time, you were also looking into writing a Nix
package for Discourse, asking how to handle complex setups that involve
databases and services.

**System and Config Troubles**

A fair amount of time went into NixOS. You ran into an error with
`nixos-option` and flakes not being found in `.config/nix`, and later were
debugging Git commit signing issues (wrong email in the commit vs author
fields). You also asked about forcing Git to use a certain SSH key or email
per repo. Other NixOS topics included setting up Wi-Fi on your Framework 16,
writing custom modules (like for Kolide), installing packages for Python and
Ruby in nix-shell, and configuring Starship with Nushell.

**Hardware and Devices**

You were troubleshooting Librewolf not showing your Bluetooth headset mic,
plus issues with Wi-Fi and Ethernet modules on the Framework. There was also
a question about pinentry not working with GPG on NixOS. On the hardware
front, you asked about pixel misalignment on your monitor and learned about
TCON as a possible cause.

**Lifestyle and Planning**

You asked about FSAs and their use. Travel came up too, with your upcoming
Europe trip and looking  for the best power adapters (especially for the Czech
Republic).

**Blogging and Writing**

Your NixOS daily driver series continued, with a post on getting Wi-Fi
working on the Framework 16. You considered what direction to take the next
entry. You also asked for an intro/about section to describe yourself,
condensing it down to 5 sentences. In parallel, you've kept up with weekly
summaries and changelog-style posts.

**Miscellaneous**

Other threads included practicing Terraform and Nomad, CSS layout questions,
and making Hyprland keybinds prompt for confirmation before closing a window.
On the wearable side, your PineTime step counter broke and you asked about
firmware, Gadgetbridge, and even writing your own step-tracking app in Rust
or Kotlin.
