This week balanced travel research, disc golf writing edits, technical
debugging, and creative design work. On the travel side, questions came up
about flying with  money internationally and how ATM fees
might look in the Czech Republic with an OnPoint credit union card. You also
researched the best European power adapters, checking Wirecutter's
recommendations for reliable options.

In Shelltrax, you continued to refine autoplay. The `play_next_track` function
was revisited to keep the footer showing artist and song info, just as before.
The main issue left was that the progress bar didn't carry over correctly
between tracks when autoplay advanced.

On the creative side, you explored what the Discourse logo might look like if
it had aged 100 years, and separately, how it could be reimagined if the
company had started as a penpal or letter-writing business. Both ideas fit into
your broader exploration of branding experiments.

The Swedish (and some German) study streak has been extended to 239 days in a
row.

Overall, the week tied together preparations for international travel, cleanup
work on ongoing projects, and a mix of technical and creative problem-solving.
