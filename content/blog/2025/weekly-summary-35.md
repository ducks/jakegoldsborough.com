This week covered a mix of personal projects, resume updates, and site tweaks.
On the budgeting front, cashctl planning continued, with refinements to the
workflow around paydays, file naming, and how income gets assigned to periods.
Simulated paycheck commands and outputs were discussed to bring the tool closer
to being usable.

Work on the personal site also came up. A Zola question about sharing one resume
template across multiple pages was raised, along with CSS improvements for
headings that stay mobile friendly while keeping within an 80-character layout.

Resume polish was another theme. A contribution to the AWS SDK for Ruby was
turned into a resume-style entry, with placement under the Discourse role
considered for now. Additional feedback was asked for on how to position open
source work.

The node-postgres-exporter project also got a GitHub star, and further
improvements were considered, such as in-memory caching and local storage to
smooth over network blips.

There was also some lighter talk--identifying a pine tree, considering Vermont
properties, and chatting about power adapters and credit scores.

Overall, the week blended cashctl development, resume building, static site
refinements, and a bit of infrastructure and personal exploration.
