The week covered a mix of practical, technical, and personal topics.

### Travel and Residency
Discussions continued around moving to Czechia. You asked about employer
documents, contracts, the passport biopage, tax implications, accommodation
requirements, and realistic timelines for when you could start working from
Prague. Flatio was identified as a likely short-term housing option.

### Anki and Language Learning
You set up an Anki deck for learning Czech. The focus was on the alphabet,
pronunciation, and use of IPA symbols. We went through how to structure the
deck, what templates should look like, and clarified things like vowel length.

### NixOS and Framework Issues
There were troubleshooting sessions with your Framework 16 and NixOS. Problems
included the command key breaking after an RGB reset, the RGB matrix not working
in Linux, and questions about whether this tied to a NixOS upgrade. We looked at
inputmodule installation, what parts of /etc are declarative, and the Framework
warranty/return policy.

### Broader NixOS Community
You asked about the NixOS steering committee drama and its connection to
Anduril, looking for current context on community governance issues.

### Practical Life Logistics
A few everyday topics came up:
- Steps for getting a car repaired after being rear-ended.
- How to cancel a Moda healthcare plan.
- Best backup plan when changing operating systems.
- Selling an old car (1974 Ford Ranchero) in Portland, with estimates for repair
  or restoration and whether shops do at-home consultations.

### Projects and Ideas
You continued brainstorming unique Discourse plugin ideas. This included using
Discourse to track flights, trains, or transit legs (with Prague trams as a test
case) and asking about APIs and boilerplate plugin setup.

### Miscellaneous
- GoatCounter analytics and why a single link share might register multiple
  views (including prefetching behavior).
- Color distribution analysis on an uploaded image, with rotations and
  measurements.
- iPad Mini use cases.
- Services to help sell or donate items at home.
- Shipping personal items from the US to Europe.
- Kastaplast first run disc valuations and market prices, including Falk, Lots,
  Stål, Göte, Berg, and Reko.

Overall, the week balanced ongoing emigration planning and language study with
NixOS troubleshooting, plugin experiments, and practical life logistics.
