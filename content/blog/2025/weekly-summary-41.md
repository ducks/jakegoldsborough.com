This week centered on publishing, polishing, and reflecting on your Discourse
work, with some light data analysis and side discussions along the way.

**Blog and Writing**

You published *"Building a Live Transit Departure Board with Discourse"*, a
follow-up to your earlier post about your first Discourse core contribution.
The piece explored how you built a live transit tracker plugin that reimagines
Discourse as a real-time data board rather than a forum. You asked if posting
it on the official Discourse blog would be weird, ultimately deciding it would
make sense given your role there. You also asked if the piece itself was
interesting -- it was, both technically and conceptually, tying in your love of
open data and infrastructure with your day job.

**Data and Analytics**

You dug into your GoatCounter analytics, examining visitor distribution across
countries. After cleaning up duplicate entries, you found **37 unique countries**
represented, spanning **six continents** -- North America, South America, Europe,
Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Europe and Asia were the strongest regions overall.
The data was reformatted into a clean markdown table for future reference.

**Open Source and Development**

You briefly noted another bug you found in the AWS SDK for Ruby, following your
previous fix and contribution, reinforcing your growing involvement in that
project's ecosystem.

**Overall**

It was a quieter week but a meaningful one -- marked by the satisfaction of
publishing a well-crafted post that blends creativity and engineering. The
analytics work helped ground your readership data, while your continued OSS
engagement kept your technical momentum going.
