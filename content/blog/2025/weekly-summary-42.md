**AWS SDK Ruby contributions and follow-up**

You published *Contributing to AWS SDK Ruby - Part 3*, which wrapped up your series
about improving the Ruby AWS SDK. You mentioned the post got 3 boosts on Mastodon
and linked to it from Hachyderm. We also talked briefly about your earlier PRs and
how they connect -- adding a feature first, then fixing a bug.

**Transit Tracker and Discourse experiments**

You released and shared *Building a Live Transit Departure Board with Discourse*,
a creative exploration of using Discourse for something non-forum-like. We talked
about whether posting it on Discourse's official blog or community site would be
weird, and you decided it'd actually fit since you work there. You also added
screenshots later to make the post more engaging.

**GoatCounter and analytics debugging**

You tried exporting page-view data from your self-hosted GoatCounter instance, but
ran into a network failure while testing the API. You realized you might not have
the admin section working yet. You also revisited an older issue about countries
being listed twice in your data and looked at the GoatCounter repo to see why.

**Personal tools and privacy**

We discussed private movement trackers for GrapheneOS, and you settled on *PFA* as
a lightweight way to track steps and distance without leaking data.

**Side notes**

You mentioned two new blog posts being live -- *Transit Tracker in Discourse* and
*Yak's Virtual Currency - Part 2* -- both updated with screenshots.
