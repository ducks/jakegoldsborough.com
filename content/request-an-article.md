## How it works

1. **You propose a topic.** Send me an email describing what you
   want to understand. Be specific: product docs, protocol specs,
   a codebase, whatever.

2. **I assess feasibility.** I'll tell you if it's something I can
   reasonably dig into, and estimate the time required.

3. **We agree on scope and payment.** Tell me how much time or
   money you want to spend, and we'll figure out what's realistic.

4. **I research and write.** The result is a public article on this
   site. I keep full editorial control. If I find the topic boring
   or the request inappropriate, I may decline.

5. **You get the write-up.** Published here, under my name. You're
   credited if you want, or anonymous if you prefer.

## What this is not

- Not a guaranteed answer. You're paying for investigation time.
- Not private consulting. The output is published publicly.
- Not ghostwriting. I write it; it goes under my byline.
- Not free. If you just have a quick question, email me anyway. I
  might answer for free if it's interesting.
