          <description xml:base="https://jakegoldsborough.com/blog/2026/building-a-robot-to-understand-humans/">&lt;p&gt;I am good with machines and bad with people.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not false modesty. I can trace a request through twelve microservices and
find the one misconfigured timeout. I can read a stack trace and know which
library is lying. I can debug race conditions that only happen on Tuesdays.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ask me to read a room? To pick up on what someone is really saying in a
meeting? To notice when a coworker is frustrated before they explicitly say so?
That is where I struggle.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;writing-is-easier&quot;&gt;Writing Is Easier&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do better with written communication. Forum posts, Slack messages, pull
request descriptions. When people write, they leave a trail I can actually
follow. I can re-read it. I can search it. I can take my time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In person, the signal moves too fast. By the time I have processed what someone
said, we have moved on. I miss the subtext because I am still working on the
text.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably why I ended up in infrastructure. Machines do not have subtext.
A 502 error is a 502 error.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;graham-duncan-s-question&quot;&gt;Graham Duncan&#x27;s Question&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A coworker recently wrote about Graham Duncan&#x27;s framework for evaluating people.
I had never heard of it, so I did some research. Duncan is an investor
known for his approach to assessing people. His core question is:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;What&#x27;s going on here, with this human?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not &quot;are they qualified?&quot; or &quot;do they have the right experience?&quot; but something
deeper. What patterns show up in how they communicate? What do they care about?
How do they handle disagreement? What are they not saying?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duncan&#x27;s framework breaks this down into dimensions:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-awareness and blind spots&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hidden motivations and fears&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How they respond to stress and uncertainty&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contextual fit (right person, wrong role?)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized this is exactly what I struggle to do in real-time with coworkers.
But what if I could do it asynchronously, with written artifacts, with a
machine&#x27;s help?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-data-is-already-there&quot;&gt;The Data Is Already There&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Discourse, we use our own product internally. Years of forum posts, technical
discussions, weekly updates, casual banter. A written record of how people
think, communicate, and collaborate.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of data I can actually work with.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I built a tool. It pulls someone&#x27;s forum activity, reads through their posts,
and generates a structured evaluation. Communication style. Areas of expertise.
How they handle disagreement. Patterns that emerge over time.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a replacement for actually talking to people. But it gives me a
starting point. A cheat sheet for understanding someone before I walk into a
1:1 or try to give feedback.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-it-actually-produces&quot;&gt;What It Actually Produces&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output is a structured report:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Executive summary (what stands out about this person?)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core strengths with evidence from actual posts&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth areas, framed constructively&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication profile (tone, clarity, patterns)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration dynamics (how do they work with others?)&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Representative quotes that capture their voice&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discussion prompts for 1:1s&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last section is the most useful for me. Specific questions I can ask based
on what someone has actually written about. Not generic &quot;how&#x27;s it going?&quot; but
&quot;you mentioned being frustrated with X last month, how&#x27;s that going?&quot;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-uncomfortable-part&quot;&gt;The Uncomfortable Part&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is something uncomfortable about using a machine to understand people.
It feels like cheating. Or like admitting a deficiency that maybe I should just
work on directly.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I have been &quot;working on it directly&quot; for decades and I am still bad at it.
At some point you have to accept your constraints and build around them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a calendar because I cannot remember appointments. I use a todo list
because I cannot hold tasks in my head. I use version control because I cannot
trust myself to not break things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not use a tool to help me understand people?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;not-a-replacement&quot;&gt;Not a Replacement&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This does not replace actual human interaction. It is prep work. The same way
you might review someone&#x27;s recent commits before a code review, or skim their
last few PRs before a 1:1.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conversations still happen. The relationship still matters. I just show up
slightly less clueless about what is going on with this human.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;try-it&quot;&gt;Try It&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool is open source if you want to try it:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot; class=&quot;language-bash &quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;claude&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; plugin marketplace add ducks&#x2F;person-eval
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt;claude&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; plugin install person-eval@person-eval&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#bf616a;&quot;&gt; --scope&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; user
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then in Claude Code:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#x2F;person-eval username https:&#x2F;&#x2F;your-discourse-site.com
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or with a timeframe for yearly reviews:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span&gt;&#x2F;person-eval username https:&#x2F;&#x2F;your-discourse-site.com 2025
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It requires the discourse-mcp server to be configured, which gives Claude Code
access to Discourse data.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-irony&quot;&gt;The Irony&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The irony is not lost on me. I built a machine to help me understand humans
because I understand machines better than humans.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe that is fine. We all have different strengths. Mine happen to involve
making robots do things. If I can make a robot help me be a better coworker,
that seems like a reasonable trade.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is not to replace human connection with machine analysis. The goal is
to show up more prepared, more aware, more able to actually connect when the
moment comes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still bad with people. But I am getting better at compensating for it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
